# Weather talk

A language to speak only about the weather.

This is a language that doesn't have vocabulary about tools or objects, body parts, food or money or transports or animals/pets or the last movie you've watched or these sort of things.

I thought it would be fun to make a language with the right vocabulary and structure to speak about the past, current or incoming weather, *and only that*.

> â€” tok makin o? *(do you want to talk about weather?)*

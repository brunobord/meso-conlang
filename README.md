# Weather talk

A language to speak only about the weather.

This is a language that doesn't have vocabulary about tools or objects, body parts, food or money or transports or animals/pets or the last movie you've watched or these sort of things.

I thought it would be fun to make a language with the right vocabulary and structure to speak about the past, current or incoming weather, *and only that*.

See the [language document](language.md) to learn more about this language, and eventually, learn it. Have fun!

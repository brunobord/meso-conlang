## Grammar

Sentence order is (S)VO.

There are no personal pronouns, since weather looks like a common experience. When somebody makes a statement, it's based on their observation and their own intuition. Questions are directed to the other person, so there's no real ambiguity. When you're asking if it's going to rain, it's implicitly requesting your opinion or *gut-feeling*.

There's no conjugation for verbs (no singular/plural, tense, etc.).

The two main important verbs, `si` and `sin` respectively express the "present tense" and the "future tense" of "to see".

# Overview

*meso* is a constructed language designed to speak only about the weather.

*meso* doesn't have vocabulary about tools or objects, body parts, food or money or transports or animals/pets or the last movie you've watched or these sort of things.

I thought it would be fun to make a language with the right vocabulary and structure to speak about the past, current or incoming weather, *and only that*.

Its first version was [published on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/r44epb/wipno_name_yet_a_language_dedicated_to_talk_about/).

This document is its latest version, written in October 2022.

## Grammar

### Basic sentences

Sentence order is (S)VO.

There are no personal pronouns, since weather is a common experience. When somebody makes a statement, it's based on their observation, their experience or their intuition.

As a consequence, subjects might be omitted, as in:

> sin shuta.  
> *forsee - rain*

Here, the subject is the person who speaks, so we may translate it as:

> *I forsee rain.*

The following sentence is SUBJECT VERB:

> oton juma.

The first word is a name ("air") and the next one is a verb ("to be cold"). So it translates as:

> *the temperature is decreasing.*

### Verbs

There's no conjugation for verbs (no singular/plural, tense, mode, etc.).

The temporal element may be provided using *si*, *sen* and *sin*. They're all related to the observation, in the past for *sen*, in the present for *si*, and the eventually future for *sin*.

You may also use temporal adverbs to express past or future events.

> — sen aseju atiwi. sen aseta tiwa. sin lume lewa.  
> — *saw - big clouds - distant past. saw - small clouds - yesterday. forsee - sun - tomorrow.*  
> — *There were big clouds a few days ago ; and small clouds yesterday. I think that tomorrow will be sunny.*

### Questions

Questions are formed with the copula *o* at the end of the sentence.

Questions are directed to the other person, so there's no real ambiguity. When you're asking if it's going to rain, it's implicitly requesting your opinion or *gut-feeling*.

Consider the following sentence:

> tok meso o?  
> *talk - weather - QUESTION?*

You may translate it as:

> *Do you want to talk about weather?*

### Conjonctions

The word "*i*" means "and". The word "*men*" means "or".

They may link several nouns or several verbs, or context words.

> sin shuta i kakatoka o?  
> *forsee - rain - AND - storm - QUESTION?*  
> *Do you forsee rain and storm?*

> sin juma men eleja  
> *forsee - be cold - OR - good*  
> *The weather could be cold or pleasing.*

### Modifiers

Modifiers are placed after the main word.

> fofeju. (*intense wind*)  
> fofe epoli joken. (*unpleasant northern wind*)  

### Etiquette

#### Prelude

When speaking this language, you'll start your conversation with the usual *tok!*, which is roughly equivalent to *hello!*.

The other person would respond with *tok! tok!*.

The next question is the ritual question mentioned above:

> tok meso o?

There are two possible answers here.

Either the person doesn't want to, so their response should simply be "*ake.*" or "*tok ake.*" to reject the discussion. From now on, the persons would carry on, say goodbye (see "Closing" section below) to each other and no further words will be exchanged until next time.

In the second case, the person is willing to talk about the weather, so they can respond with *awi* or *tok awi*, followed by their impression about the current or incoming weather. Such as:

> — tok awi. lume tiwa i powa. (*I want to talk. It was sunny yesterday, same for today.*)

#### Closing

When the small talk is over, it's time to wrap up the discussion. One of the person will simply say: "*tok tono*"". If the other agrees, they'll respond with "*tono awi*", and this closes the dialogue. Eventually, if the other person has another remark or question, they can express it, but it is considered as rude to insist and going on with the discussion while at least one person has expressed their desire to end it.

### Advanced sentence structure

Full sentence structure would look like:

> (SUBJ) VERB ADVERB OBJECT TIME SPACE.

Time context will express if the statement is for the near future (later today, tomorrow) or in a more distant future (this week, or even up to the next season).

Space context will mostly be based on the cardinal points to express where does the meteorological phenomenon comes from.

> sin fofe i shu lewa lushin.  
> *forsee - wind - and - rain - tomorrow - from West.*  
> *Wind and rain will come from the West tomorrow.*

When there are several vebrs or context words (separated by *men* or *i*, for example), the adverb goes after the group.

> sin juma i oshen tono.  
> *forsee - cold - and - snow - finish*  
> *The cold and the snow will stop.*

## Syntax

When transcribed, the meso words are all-lowercase.

Sentences usually end with a *"."*.

Even when the "o" particle is used for questions, you should also add a *"?"* at the end of an interrogative sentence.

Exclamation marks express surprise or emphasis.

Although not forbidden, commas are rarely used, since sentences tend to be short. Same for colons and semi-colons.

Typography rules for punctuation are the same than the English ones: there's no space before full stops, question or exclamation marks, and there's a space after.

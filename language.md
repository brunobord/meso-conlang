## Grammar

### Basic sentences

Sentence order is (S)VO.

There are no personal pronouns, since weather looks like a common experience. When somebody makes a statement, it's based on their observation and their own intuition.

As a consequence, subjects might be omitted, as in:

> sin shuta.
> forsee rain

Here, the subject is the person who speaks, so we may translate it as:

> I forsee rain.

The following sentence is SUBJECT VERB:

> oton juma.

The first word is a name ("temperature") and the next one is a verb ("decrease"). So it translates as:

> the temperature is decreasing.

### Verbs

There's no conjugation for verbs (no singular/plural, tense, etc.).

The two main important verbs, `si` and `sin` respectively express the "present tense" and the "future tense" of "to see".

### Questions

Questions are formed with the copula `o` at the end of the sentence.

Questions are directed to the other person, so there's no real ambiguity. When you're asking if it's going to rain, it's implicitly requesting your opinion or *gut-feeling*.

Consider the following sentence:

> tok makin o?
> talk weather QUESTION?

### Prelude / Etiquette

When speaking this language, you'll start your conversation with the usual *tok!*, which is roughly equivalent to *hello!*.

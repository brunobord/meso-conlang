## Grammar

### Basic sentences

Sentence order is (S)VO.

There are no personal pronouns, since weather looks like a common experience. When somebody makes a statement, it's based on their observation and their own intuition.

As a consequence, subjects might be omitted, as in:

> sin shuta.
> forsee - rain

Here, the subject is the person who speaks, so we may translate it as:

> I forsee rain.

The following sentence is SUBJECT VERB:

> oton juma.

The first word is a name ("temperature") and the next one is a verb ("decrease"). So it translates as:

> the temperature is decreasing.

### Verbs

There's no conjugation for verbs (no singular/plural, tense, mode, etc.).

We may consider that there's a *tense* element between `si` and `sin`, for example, because they respectively express the "present tense" and the "future tense" of "to see".

### Questions

Questions are formed with the copula `o` at the end of the sentence.

Questions are directed to the other person, so there's no real ambiguity. When you're asking if it's going to rain, it's implicitly requesting your opinion or *gut-feeling*.

Consider the following sentence:

> tok makin o?
> talk - weather - QUESTION?

You may translate it as:

> Do you want to talk about weather?

### Prelude / Etiquette

When speaking this language, you'll start your conversation with the usual *tok!*, which is roughly equivalent to *hello!*.

The other person would respond with *tok! tok!*.

The next question is the ritual question mentioned above:

> tok makin o?

There are two possible answers here.

Either the person doesn't want to, so their response should simply be *ake.* or *tok ake.* to reject the discussion. From now on, the persons would carry on and no further questions will be asked.

Or the person is willing to talk about the weather, so they can respond with *awi* or *tok awi*, followed by their impression about the current or incoming weather. Such as:

> — awi tok. lume tiwa i powa. (*I want to talk. It was sunny yesterday, same for today.*)

## Advanced sentence structure

Full sentence structure would look like:

> (SUBJ) VERB ADVERB OBJECT TIME SPACE.

Time context will express if the statement is for the near future (later today, tomorrow) or in a more distant future (this week, or even up to the next season).

Space context will mostly be based on the cardinal points to express where does the meteorological phenomenon comes from.
